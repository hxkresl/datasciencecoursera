##This is a markdown file

The README file is a convention that summarises what your repo is about. It is automatically rendered on the main page of the repo and resides in the root directory.

This README uses Markdown which has it's own conventions, different from HTML. For example, ## is used for headlines and * for unordered bullet lists.

The creation of this repo was part of an assignment in the Data Science Toolbox course Nov 2014. I expect that this repo will continue to be used for the remainder of this courses series.
